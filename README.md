# Making-my-Own-Calculator #


## Motivation ##

In grade 8, armed with an Arduino board and a passion for technology, 
I embarked on an ambitious project to create my very own mechanical calculator. It was an exciting challenge and I did it what I aspired. But soon realized that e
ven simple calculations required an immense amount of effort. 
Fast forward to the present day, my scientific calculator stopped functioning, leaving me without a reliable tool for my mathematical pursuits. The laptop and mobile calculators lacked the sophistication I craved. It was at this moment I made a bold decisionâ€”to develop my own calculator using coding.

As the saying goes, "Necessity is the mother of invention," and this project exemplified the very essence of that sentiment. Motivated by the need for a more advanced and personalized calculator, I set out on a journey to create a digital masterpiece. With coding as my tool, I knew I could fashion a calculator that would surpass any I had previously encountered.
